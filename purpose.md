Law and space are intertwined all around us in ways that powerfully--and often subtly--shape our lived experience.

Red lining, the practice of refusing to lend to people living in predominantly Black neighborhoods, shaped the urban geography of the United States. Border enforcement policies Europe attempt to prevent refugees from reaching EU soil where they could file asylum claims. Water rights and land rights are contested by Indigenous peoples around the world, exacerbated by the threat of climate change.

At the level of the everyday, legal restrictions around where people are lawfully allowed to skateboard, where people are permitted to protest (so-called "free speech zones"), and even how long ones grass must be kept in certain neighborhoods--all of these shape life in routine ways that do not always draw critical attention.

On the other hand, judges, police officers, and legislators all rely on particular conceptions of space and place when making decisions about how to rule upon legal cases, enforce the law, or write law. The hegemony of law typically relies on an alleged distinction between the operations of law and the messy reality of lived experience.

Yet the people who make the law are, in fact, deeply entangled in their own sets of relationships, worldviews, and assumptions that shape what counts as legalized and illegalized social practices. As a result, law contains implicit--often uninvestigated--theories of society and space.

Legal geography is a field of scholarly research that investigates these complex, historical, and nuanced questions about how law shapes space, and how space shapes law. From police officers' strategic use of space to justify traffic stops and make arrests to the ways in which debates over gender and sexuality become fought on the terrain of access to space (for example, through so-called "bathroom bills"), legal geography provides a unique interdisciplinary perspective on the most important issues of our time.

Despite a productive tradition of research and publications, legal geography does not have a dedicated academic journal. Many graduate students and scholars whose work intersects with legal geography find themselves adrift in the literature because there is no designated public forum for discussing issues in legal geography, sharing new research, developing dissertation reading lists, popularizing legal geography scholarship, and finding advisors and collaborators.

In that gap, the Law & Space (un)Journal emerges as an exciting new hub for legal geography. Law & Space operates through an informal web-based journal model that ensures quality through editors and advisors that are leading academics in the field while emphasizing accessibility and timeliness to the benefit of a wide variety of academic and non-academic readers. Through short original research articles, book and article reviews, profiles, conference information, and the opportunity for non-traditional contributions, Law & Space aims to incubate a new generation of scholars and re-invigorate legal geography for years to come.

The Law & Space (un)Journal is a shared project among many legal geographers and existing disciplinary groups, but remains intentionally unaffiliated and undisciplined. If you are passionate about questions of law and space, Law & Space (un)Journal is for you.
