Law & Space (un)Journal accepts a wide variety of short blog-style articles written with academic integrity but intended for a broad audience. (See the [Border Criminologies](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies) blog at Oxford University for inspiration.)

We are particularly interested in short summaries of ongoing research projects (including the work of current graduate students), summaries of your own recent academic publications written for a broad audience, explanations or discussions of key topics in legal geography, application of legal geography concepts to timely public issues, conference-related announcements, and profiles of important figures and thinkers in legal geography.

Submissions do not have a word limit, but we aim for articles that are between 500 and 1,200 words. Our tone is intelligent but readable, with short, punchy paragraphs, selective citations, and a clear lede that will attract academic and non-academic readers alike.

If you would like to publish a post through Law & Space, reach out directly to Austin Kocher at ackocher@syr.edu or lawandspacejournal@gmail.com. Pitches are encouraged rather than full submissions.

Please note that this project is currently in an early phase of development, so publishing protocols and pathways are currently in the process of being finalized.
