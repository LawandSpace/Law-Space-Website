## Call for Abstracts and Sessions

The first critical legal geography conference brings together transdisciplinary scholars to discuss the mutual constitution of space and law, broadly conceived. The conference in February 2024 (in Turin, Italy) will be the first of a series of annual meetings on critical legal geography.

This open call intends to create a wide space for application and interpretation of critical legal geography. We do not intend to be prescriptive concerning its method, theory, object, or approach. The conference will be an inclusive and dialogical meeting, with a relaxed discussion and exchange of ideas. 

Those interested in participating have two options: 
One is to respond to one or more keywords below by proposing a reflection of not more than 500 words (alternatively, also traditional abstracts are also accepted). Name(s), affiliation(s), and short bio(s) (maximum 200 words) of the authors must be included as well.

The second option is to self-organise and propose a thematic session. In this case, you must submit a broad overview of the session, together with the titles of the contributions (minimum 3, maximum 4), names, affiliations, and short bios of the participants. In the spirit of dialogue and flexibility, if we receive a proposal that better suits a proposed thematic suggestion, we may ask you to make space for the additional presentation. 
In selecting abstracts, we will make every effort to reflect diverse perspectives, in particular, from groups which are under-represented. Such considerations will not be limited to gender, race, ethnicity, ability, and economic status, and will take into account intersectional diversity as a whole.


#### Keywords for reflection:

- energy and extraction
- (post)(neo)(settler)colonialism
- the global/the local
- method
- anthropocene

## PhD Workshop “Explorations in Critical Legal Geographies”

The workshop brings together 15 PhD students with a variety of backgrounds (legal, geographical, political, sociological, anthropological, urban studies, and so on), whose doctoral thesis speaks to critical legal-geographical debates. The workshop offers participants a forum to contribute to their research development in a cross/transdisciplinary manner and opportunity to create synergies across the legal-geographical spectrum.

#### Themes and rationale

This workshop is conceived as a meeting to reflect on the methodologies, discourses, theories, and practices characterising the legal-geographical entanglement. This workshop is an integral part of the First Annual Critical Legal Geography Conference; therefore, all the participants selected for the workshop are also encouraged to submit to (or take part in) the conference. 

The aim of the workshop is to explore the main topics of the conference (as listed above) by focusing on the research methodologies and design. The workshop is thus aimed at providing support and training to early career scholars who are examining legal-geographical themes and questions.

#### Programme

The 4-hour workshop will be organised as an event within the First Annual Critical Geography Conference on 21 February 2024. It will have an interactive format to facilitate communication and debates between PhD students, who are expected to engage in active participation before, during, and after the workshop. The detailed programme of the workshop will be circulated following selection of the candidates.

#### How to apply

To apply for the workshop, please submit the following to <daniela.morpurgo@polito.it> and <matteo.nicolini@univr.it> by __15 October 2013__:

-   Abstract of the doctoral thesis (max. 500 words); 

-   PhD program where the candidate is currently enrolled;

-   Essay (3,000-3,500 words) where the candidate must clearly state: the research question(s); main topics and arguments; the structure of the research; the proposed methodology; the state of the art; salient topics, arguments, and doubts they might want to discuss during the workshop; Candidates should also refer to the scale (geographical, legal, sociological, etc.) within which the research is being conducted.

Applications will be assessed by the Steering Committee of the conference. The assessment of the essay will be based on the originality of the argument, the analytical approach, and references to academic literature on the topic. 

No fee is required to take part in the PhD workshop.
