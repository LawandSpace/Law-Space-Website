When a [plane carrying 50 migrants](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/us/politics/migrants-marthas-vineyard.html) landed in Martha's Vineyard from Texas last week, it contributed to confusion among the migrants and among people living on the island [who responded quickly and generously](https://www.cbsnews.com/boston/news/migrants-arrive-warm-welcome-marthas-vineyard/).

Central to this legal claim is what we might call the manipulative use of geography to undermine dignity and autonomy.

Chaos

The actions of Abbott and DeSantis have come under fire for sowing confusion and chaos among immigrants and within the immigration system. But
