The conference aims to stimulate robust and thoughtful engagement with ideas and experiences of confinement across a diverse range of settings: from prisons and remand centres; immigration detention, border control and asylum; disability, aged care or children’s residential ‘care’ settings; places of human or non-human/animal captivity; to boundaries and borders created by law or conquest.

We are keen to explore theoretical and experiential perspectives on inhabiting, living and working in places of confinement and to examine the uneasy tensions within and across diverse sites, settings, histories, logics and practices of care and control.

Specific themes include:
- Diverse sites of confinement, intersections of ‘care’ and control
- Abolitionist perspectives on practices of coercive confinement and carcerality
- Elemental (air, water, land) and sensory aspects (sounds, smells) of confinement
- Art as a site/practice of resistance and/or memorialisation
- Intersections of human, non-human & animal captivity
- Historical sites of confinement, histories of violence
- Monitoring, oversight and accountability
- COVID, confinement and quarantine
- Settler colonialism and its legacies
- Time, temporalities, waiting
- …and other related themes and topics
