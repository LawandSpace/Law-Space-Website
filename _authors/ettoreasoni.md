Ettore Asoni holds a PhD in Geography from San Diego State University and University of California, Santa Barbara. His dissertation examines US immigration law and immigration detention from a legal-geographic perspective. His current work draws from legal geography and carceral geography to analyze the territorial dynamics that underpin regimes of (im)mobility, and especially across systems of immigration control in the European region. He is originally from Sardinia, Italy.
