Dr. Austin Kocher is the founding editor of the Law & Space (un)Journal. He is a Research Assistant Professor at Syracuse University that uses Freedom of Information Act requests to study the federal government. Kocher’s research interests focus on the political and legal geographies of racialized policing practices, local immigration enforcement, and the immigration court system. His ongoing work interrogates the legal rationalities and everyday practices of producing “illegalized” immigrants through the US immigration court system, and he uses cartographic, ethnographic, and quantitative methodologies to examine how the immigration courts link up with local immigration enforcement on the ground. His work also examines the strategies and impact of grassroots immigrant rights and worker rights movements that contest deportation as a tool of social and labor control.
