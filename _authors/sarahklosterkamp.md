Sarah Klosterkamp (she/her) is a feminist political and social geographer, currently employed at the University of Bonn, Germany. Her work investigates how the law proceeds and multiplies classed and racialized geographies of inequalities within and through state-driven institutions such as courts, asylum facilities, employment offices, and carceral spaces. Within her current project as a PostDoc, she spotlights eviction process and the housing crisis in Europe.
