Meagan Harden is a Ph.D. Candidate in Geography at the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and a Student Affiliate at the East West Center in Honolulu. Her research explores American military imperialism in island spaces, focusing particularly on the reconfiguration of law and discourse in pursuit of territorial expansion. Meagan’s dissertation project traces the consolidation of the United States military in the former Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (comprised of what are today the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia), and islander responses within international institutions. Other research interests include volumetrics, gendered politics of territoriality, and Oceanian navigation practices.
